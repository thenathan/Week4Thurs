This is my week4 Thurs HW
4.6.1 SCB

Basically these are all conditions and loops which I get the gist of it but not exactly.
I think they will make more sense once we try them out.

1) hello will be printed for how many "i"s there are
2) hello will be printed for the number of j's but that j has a condition
which is %3
3) this one has two condtions both having to do with j

I am assuming the letters stand for a variable

4) Something else
5) More conditional stuff, just gets gnarlier and gnarlier conditions

not sure what fooXX does
